bus_stabilizer
- Phase-lock filter for aging distribution busses.
- Dampens transient spikes and line noise.
- Restores smoother load-sharing across subsystems.
- Common in long-haul retrofit kits.
- Installation requires brief bus re-sync.
- Side effect: slightly higher idle draw.
- Recommended when Q is unstable.
Lore: These units were nicknamed "calmers" by deck crews.
