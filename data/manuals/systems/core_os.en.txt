SYSTEM BRIEF — core_os
Ref: OS-MAN/SYS/CORE-OS

core_os is the ship’s minimal supervisory layer. If it fails, you lose command authority.

Role
- Schedules jobs, routes alerts, maintains operator session.
- Provides the basic command interface.

Symptoms of degradation
- Missing telemetry, delayed job execution, corrupted logs.

Operational notes
- Treated as critical. The ship will attempt to preserve it during shedding.
- If the bus becomes unstable (low Q), core_os may become unreliable long before it “dies”.
- LIMITED: advanced commands blocked (uplink, route solve, auth recover).
- CRITICAL: emergency recovery command set active.
- OFFLINE: terminal control lost. Only basic help/status/exit remain.

Command impact by state
- NOMINAL/LIMITED: normal command set (LIMITED blocks uplink/route solve/auth recover).
- CRITICAL: allowed commands include status, alerts, logs, jobs, power status, power on/off/plan, drone emergency/recovery actions, diag, help, exit.
- OFFLINE: allowed commands include help, status, exit.

Relevant commands
- status, alerts, logs, diag core_os
