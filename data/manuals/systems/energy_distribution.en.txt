SYSTEM BRIEF — energy_distribution
Ref: OS-MAN/SYS/DIST

energy_distribution is the ship’s bus and routing layer: breakers, phase alignment, trunk lines.

Role
- Delivers power from power_core to all systems.
- Maintains phase alignment and prevents oscillation.

Why it matters
- Many systems require distribution to be at least nominal to boot safely.
- If damaged, Q drops and bus instability may cascade.

Common symptoms
- low_power_quality
- power_bus_instability (if damage persists)

Typical recovery
- Deploy a drone to the trunk location and repair energy_distribution.
- If you find stabilization modules, install them (e.g., bus_stabilizer).

Relevant commands
- diag energy_distribution, repair <drone> energy_distribution, alerts explain power_bus_instability
