SYSTEM BRIEF — life_support
Ref: OS-MAN/SYS/LIFE

life_support keeps the capsule viable: oxygenation, thermal control, nutrient perfusion.

Role
- Maintains capsule atmosphere and metabolic support.
- Regulates temperature and CO₂ scrubbing.

Failure modes
- Slow drift (most common): efficiency loss → increasing load and alarms.
- Catastrophic loss: capsule viability countdown. If CRITICAL persists, terminal state will trigger.

Operational notes
- Treated as critical. Shedding it is equivalent to surrender.
- If you must cut power, cut everything else first.
- LIMITED/CRITICAL: hibernation blocked until stabilized.

Command impact by state
- LIMITED: hibernate blocked.
- CRITICAL: hibernate blocked; grace countdown starts. If sustained, terminal state triggers.
- OFFLINE: terminal state; command set severely restricted.

Relevant commands
- status, alerts, diag life_support
