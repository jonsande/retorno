drone_bay
- Drone launch subsystem.
- In emergencies use deploy!.

Command impact by state
- NOMINAL: normal support (deploy/recall/install/reboot ETA baseline, normal charging).
- LIMITED: support degraded (affected operations slower, charging slower).
- DAMAGED: support severely degraded (affected operations much slower, charging much slower, minor integrity risk on deploy/recall).
- LIMITED: passive docked-drone integrity repairs are slower.
- DAMAGED: passive docked-drone integrity repairs stay slow and consume more scrap.
- CRITICAL: passive docked-drone integrity repairs are even slower, consume high scrap, and may fail with minor damage.
- OFFLINE: no bay support. drone deploy is blocked; use drone deploy! for emergency launch.
- OFFLINE: drone install is blocked (requires bay support). drone recall still works, but charging remains unavailable.
- While energy_distribution is OFFLINE, charging and passive bay repairs are unavailable even if drone_bay itself is online.

Control vs bay support
- Drone control depends on core_os minimum control link plus drone battery.
- Bay state affects support functions (charging, deploy/recall/install/reboot timing), not remote control of already deployed drones.
