SYSTEM BRIEF — sensors
Ref: OS-MAN/SYS/SENS

sensors is your reach beyond the capsule: signal capture, passive scan, contact inference.

Role
- Detects contacts (scan, contacts).
- Identifies signals and basic node classification.

Boot requirements
- Requires energy_distribution >= nominal (bus stability).
- The service is sensord (must be booted separately).

Operational notes
- In CRUISE/hibernation profiles, sensors may be disabled by default to save power.
- A running sensord on an offline system is a fault; reboot after restoring the system.

Relevant commands
- boot sensord, diag sensors, scan, contacts

Command impact by state
- BELOW LIMITED (DAMAGED/CRITICAL/OFFLINE): route solve blocked.
- OFFLINE or sensord not running: scan/contacts are blocked or ineffective.
