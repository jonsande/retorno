SYSTEM BRIEF — power_core
Ref: OS-MAN/SYS/CORE-PWR

power_core provides primary generation to the ship.

Role
- Converts stored/reactive mass into electrical output.
- Stabilizes output within tolerances when the bus is healthy.

Output impact (by state)
- OFFLINE: 0% generation
- CRITICAL: 25% generation
- DAMAGED: 50% generation
- LIMITED: 75% generation
- NOMINAL: 100% generation

Health thresholds (default)
- health <= 0.00 -> OFFLINE
- health < 0.35  -> CRITICAL
- health < 0.60  -> DAMAGED
- health < 0.85  -> LIMITED
- health >= 0.85 -> NOMINAL

What “degraded” means
- Output may be throttled or noisy.
- Net effect: lower P_gen, lower Q under load, faster aging elsewhere.

Command impact by state
- CRITICAL/DAMAGED/LIMITED: reduced P_gen increases risk of low Q and brownout.
- OFFLINE: zero generation. Expect brownout unless load is minimal.

Typical recovery
- Use a maintenance drone to repair power_core.
- If you have modules, install generation patches (future: micro_reactor_patch).

Relevant commands
- power status, alerts explain power_core_degraded, diag power_core, repair <drone> power_core
