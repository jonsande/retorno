SYSTEM BRIEF — power_core
Ref: OS-MAN/SYS/CORE-PWR

power_core provides primary generation to the ship.

Role
- Converts stored/reactive mass into electrical output.
- Stabilizes output within tolerances when the bus is healthy.

What “degraded” means
- Output may be throttled or noisy.
- Net effect: lower P_gen, lower Q under load, faster aging elsewhere.

Typical recovery
- Use a maintenance drone to repair power_core.
- If you have modules, install generation patches (future: micro_reactor_patch).

Relevant commands
- power status, alerts explain power_core_degraded, diag power_core, repair <drone> power_core
