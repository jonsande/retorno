low_power_quality
- Power quality below nominal range.
- Causes: low SoC, sustained deficit, distribution damage.
- If persistent: system degradation accelerates.
Escalation:
- Q < 0.55: complex ops blocked (uplink, route solve, auth recover).
- Q < 0.40: hibernate and non-critical boots blocked.
- Q < 0.25: ship sheds non-critical systems; collapse risk.
Recommended: stabilize distribution, reduce load, restore SoC.
