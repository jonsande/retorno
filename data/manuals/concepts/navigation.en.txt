SHIP OS — Navigation & Route Knowledge (Field Copy)
Ref: OS-MAN/ENG/NAV-01

You do not “see” the galaxy as a complete map. The capsule terminal operates on partial knowledge:
- contacts detected by sensors (scan range is limited),
- and routes obtained from recorded navigation data (intel).
Routes can be acquired through:
- uplink at relays/waystations,
- route solving within sensor range,
- intel import (logs/fragments/mail),
- scan if a hub is exactly co-located with your current position.

Relays
A relay is legacy infrastructure: an automated beacon that repeats signals and caches route tables.
If a relay still responds, you may extract:
- reachable destinations (routes),
- long-range echoes (old broadcasts),
- and partial navigation fragments.

Coordinates vs IDs
- sector: a grid cell, identified as S{sx}_{sy}_{sz} (derived from x/y/z in ly).
- coord: sector coordinates reported for a contact.
- id: the actual node identifier used in commands (nav/travel, dock).
A contact can share a sector with others but has its own id.

Operational notes
- A contact can be known without a known route. Knowing “it exists” is not the same as knowing “how to get there”.
- Relays may be degraded, silent, or looping old data. Do not assume any broadcast is current.
- In a ruined network, relays are often the only way to expand navigation knowledge without blind jumps.

Relevant commands
- scan, nav, route, uplink, intel import, travel, dock, undock
