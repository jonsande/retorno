travel <node_id>
travel --no-cruise <node_id>
travel abort
- Alias of nav. Prefer: nav <node_id> | nav --no-cruise <node_id> | nav abort.
- Start interstellar transit to the target node.
- By default, travel auto-sets CRUISE for efficiency.
- Use --no-cruise to keep the current mode (advanced; higher wear).
- travel abort cancels the current transit and returns to the origin.
- Shows ETA in years; ship goes in-transit until arrival.
- Operational commands are blocked during transit.
