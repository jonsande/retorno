drone status

Status fields
- status: docked / deployed / disabled
- loc: current location (ship_sector or world_node)
- battery: charge level (0..1)
- integrity: structural condition (0..1)
- dose: accumulated radiation exposure (rad)

Operational notes
- Drone actions consume battery (deploy/move/repair/install/salvage/recall/reboot).
- Deployed drones also drain battery slowly while idle.
- Charging happens in drone_bay while bay/distribution support is available.
- `drone repair` accepts ship systems and drones as targets.
- To repair another drone, the operator drone must be deployed and co-located with the target drone.
- drone_bay LIMITED/DAMAGED slows deploy/recall/install/reboot and charging.
- drone_bay OFFLINE blocks normal deploy and install; use deploy! for emergency launch.
- Avoid running the battery to zero before recall; a dead drone may be stranded.
- Emergency deploy may risk failure and integrity loss.
