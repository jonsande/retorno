dock <node_id>
- Dock the ship at a node.
- Requirements:
- You must not be in transit.
- You must already be at the target node (in orbit).
- The target must be a known contact.
- Docking may be disallowed at some nodes (e.g., origin).
- Docking queues a job; check status with jobs.
- To leave dock and return to orbit, use: undock
- Dock duration is configured by `Balance.DOCK_TIME_S`.
- Dock can be interrupted if context changes before completion (for example, ship enters transit), or cancelled with `job cancel <job_id>`.
