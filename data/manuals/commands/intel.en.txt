intel show <intel_id>
- Shows details and provenance for a specific intel item.

intel import <path>
- Imports navigation intel from a file.
- Supported markers: NODE:, LINK:, SECTOR:, COORD:
- Optional blocks:
  [INTEL] ... [/INTEL]
  - If the block contains a LINK, it is imported as a route.
  - If it contains a node_id, name, or sector id, the matching authored node is added as a known contact.
  - Corrupt intel may fail to resolve or yield a new (unknown) hub contact.
- Files under /data/nav, /mail or /logs may auto-import on cat.

intel export <path>
- Exports current intel to a file under /logs/nav or /data/nav.
