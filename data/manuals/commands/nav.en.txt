navigation <...> (alias)
- nav routes: show known routes from the current node.
- nav <dest>: start interstellar transit to a known node or contact name.
- nav --no-cruise <dest>: travel without auto-setting CRUISE (advanced; higher wear).
- nav abort: cancel the current transit and return to the origin.
- Routes are obtained via: uplink (relay/waystation), route, intel import (nav logs/fragments), or scan if a hub is co-located with your current position.
- If no routes appear, acquire navigation intel or attempt uplink/route.
- travel remains accepted as an alias for nav.
