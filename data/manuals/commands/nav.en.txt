nav
- Shows known routes from the current node.
- Routes can be obtained via: uplink (relay/waystation), route, intel import (nav logs/fragments), or scan if a hub is co-located with your current position.
- Use after scan, route, uplink, or intel import to see where travel is possible.
- If no routes appear, acquire navigation intel or attempt uplink/route.
