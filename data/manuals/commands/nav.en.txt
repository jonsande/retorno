nav <node_id>
nav --no-cruise <node_id>
nav abort
navigation <...> (alias)
- nav routes: show known routes from the current node.
- nav <node_id>: start interstellar transit to a known node id.
- nav --no-cruise <node_id>: travel without auto-setting CRUISE (advanced; higher wear).
- nav abort: cancel the current transit and return to the origin.
- If you are docked, undock first (`undock`) before starting nav.
- Routes are obtained via: uplink (relay/waystation), route solve, intel import (nav logs/fragments), or scan if a hub is co-located with your current position.
- If no routes appear, acquire navigation intel or attempt uplink/route solve.
- travel remains accepted as an alias for nav.
