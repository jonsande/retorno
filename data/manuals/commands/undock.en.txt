undock
- Leave dock and return to in-orbit state at the current node.
- Requirements:
- Ship must be currently docked at the current node.
- Ship must not be in transit.
- If there are drones outside the ship (deployed/disabled in world nodes), a confirmation warning is required before undocking.
- If power state is critical, undock can be blocked as a non-essential action.
- Undock queues a job; undock duration is configured by `Balance.UNDOCK_TIME_S`.
- Undock can be interrupted if context changes before completion, or cancelled with `job cancel <job_id>`.
