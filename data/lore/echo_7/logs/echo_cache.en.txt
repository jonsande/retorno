ECHO-7 RELAY — CACHE REPORT (RECOVERED)
Ref: E7/OPS/CACHE/0007
Access: ENG (read-only)
Integrity: degraded (partial reconstruction)

This file is a relay-side snapshot of cached routing and operational notes. It was generated automatically from housekeeping buffers and later reconstructed from incomplete storage blocks. Timestamps are unreliable; ordering is estimated.

Over the last recorded period, the relay spent most of its duty cycle relaying low-band handshake traffic and short routing announcements. Long-range carriers were frequently unavailable, either due to upstream silence or local amplification faults. The relay’s route cache therefore skews toward nearby waystations and repeated corridor handoffs.

The token HARBOR-12 appears unusually often in the cached tables. That does not mean Harbor-12 was “important” in an abstract sense; it means many routes were being pushed through it. In practical terms: ships that still had working nav hardware were being told to pass through Harbor-12 rather than attempting long direct legs or relying on relays that were already failing intermittently.

A short operator annotation was found embedded in a routing packet payload. The relay preserved it because it matched a checksum profile; it does not indicate endorsement or validity. The text is reproduced verbatim:

“Route maps are stale. Don’t waste time chasing the loud stuff. If a station answers, use it. Harbor-12 is still answering (for now). If you’re late, follow the corridor tables. If you’re early, don’t wait.”
